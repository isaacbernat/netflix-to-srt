#### It is used to convert the <span style="color: pink;">`.vtt`</span> and <span style="color: pink;">`.xml`</span> files into the <span style="color: pink;">`.srt`</span> format. We do this because it is widely supported by various media players, platforms, and devices, as many popular media players (e.g., VLC, Windows Media Player) and streaming services prefer <span style="color: pink;">`.srt`</span>, as it is universal and simple & standardized.

> **<span style="color: pink;">Note:</span>**  
> I also found that VLC Player could not reproduce these kinds of XML subtitles, and I could not find any tool that could easily transform XML files to a suitable format (e.g., SubRip <span style="color: pink;">`.srt`</span>) on Linux or macOS. I got a request for WebVTT (<span style="color: pink;">`.vtt`</span>) and added support for it as well; that's why it encouraged me to make this.

# 2. YouTube-To-SRT üé¨



- Install [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) (available for Windows, Mac and Linux)
- Download subs from the YouTube URL you like e.g. `youtube-dl --all-subs "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHNfvFOBC0A"`
- Subtitles should be downloaded in the same folder where the command was run. E.g. `NameOfTheVideo VHNfvFOBC0A.ca.vtt, NameOfTheVideo VHNfvFOBC0A.tlh.vtt`
- If you are missing a language, check that it's actually available. E.g. `youtube-dl --list-subs "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHNfvFOBC0A"`

> <br>

> **<span style="color: pink;">Install using Snap:</span>**  
> - Install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) using Snap:
> ```bash
> sudo snap install yt-dlp
> ```
> - To download subtitles in SRT format from a YouTube URL, use:
> ```bash
>  yt-dlp --skip-download --write-auto-subs --convert-subs srt --sub-lang "en" "https://youtu.be/cVsyJvxX48A" 
> ```
> This command downloads only the subtitles in SRT format.
> - If you want to download the subtitles in VTT format, you can use:
> ```bash
> yt-dlp --skip-download --write-auto-subs --sub-lang "en" "https://youtu.be/cVsyJvxX48A"
> ```
> - To download the video with audio and subtitles, simply omit the --skip-download option:
> ```bash
> yt-dlp --write-auto-subs --sub-lang "en" "https://youtu.be/cVsyJvxX48A"
> ```
>> <span style="color: pink;">Note:</span>
>> If you don't enable subtitles in the YouTube video (captions), then the command will not work as expected. Make sure to enable subtitles before running the command.

## Clone Repo & Run Files üìÅ


- [Get Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (tested under Python 2.7, 3.3, and newer). *If you have Mac or Linux, you may skip this step.*

- Clone this repository or [download the ZIP file](https://github.com/isaacbernat/netflix-to-srt/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/isaacbernat/netflix-to-srt.git
```
- Navigate to the project directory and run the script using the terminal:
```bash
cd netflix-to-srt
```
- Run the conversion script with the following command:

```bash 
python3 main.py --input ./samples/vtt_input --output ./samples/srt_output
```
This will convert all .vtt files of the vtt_input folder into .srt format and place them in the srt_output folder.

- If you want to convert .xml files into .srt, use the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py --input ./samples/xml_input --output ./samples/srt_output
```
This will convert all .xml files of the xml_input folder into .srt format and place them in the srt_output folder.

- You will now see all the .srt files in the srt_output folder located under the samples folder.




## TODOs üêô
- **Javascript/web version:** This would allow users to convert subtitles directly through a browser without needing to install Python or any dependencies.

- **Real tests:** You could create proper unit or integration tests to automate checking whether subtitle conversion works as expected.

- **Create a pip package:** This would simplify installation for users by allowing them to install the script via Python's package manager.
